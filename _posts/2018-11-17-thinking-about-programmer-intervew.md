title: "Thinking about Programmer Interview - 2"
---

I've written [an article about programmer interview for fresh](http://secfree.github.io/blog/2016/09/25/the-first-time-as-a-interviewer.html), so this is the second one.

I've conducted a lot of interviews this year, most candidates are from social, some are fresh.

I assess a candidate with the following forms.

For a fresh

| Feature | Weight(1-5) | Value(1-5) | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Computer Science Basic Knowledge | 4 | - | Such as operating system, computer network |
| Code/Project Experience | 3 | - | - |
| Algorithm + Data Structure | 4 | - | - |
| Clever | 5 | - | - |
| Character | 5 | - | - |
| Communication | 3 | - | - |
| School | 3 | - | If someone is from a famous school, <br />he will get a high score.Not fair, but reasonable.|

For a candidate who has working experience

| Feature | Weight(1-5) | Value(1-5) | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Computer Science Basic Knowledge | 3 | - | - |
| Project Experience | 5 | - | Interesting? Valuable? Match the job? |
| Coding Style | 3 | - | - |
| Clever | 4 | - | - |
| Character | 5 | - | - |
| Communication | 3 | - | - |
| Teamwork | 4 | - | - |
| History Companies | 4 | - | Well-known companies are preferred.<br />Do not change job frequently. |

Notes

- Some candidates have very good school and company background, but very general technical level. So do not be credulous.
- For a senior candidate, his thinking and answers should be systematically.
- For a candidate who has worker several years, I think it's unfair/nonsense to test his algorithm level. So I just focus on the data structure and his coding style.
- A most times, what the candidate talk in the interview will not make him `senior` enough. He should show his accumulation of the past years.
