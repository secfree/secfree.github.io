title: "The Evolution of my note-taking Method and Tool"
---

Taking notes is quite important to (a programmer)/(an engineer), as we need to

- Involve a lot of details to implement a program or resolve real problems.
- Learn a lot of new technologies to improve systems.
- Have good structure learning and thinking to beyond scattered points and details. Which needs us to adjust the old structure based on previous notes.

My note-taking method and tool have evolved four generations in the past 8+ years of working.

# Generation 1: take notes as documents

<br />

Requirements

1. Support rich-text documents.
2. Sync between different clients.

Tools

- Evernote

# Generation 2: use markup language to replace rich-text

<br />

Requirements

1. Support markup language. Then we have a standard way to format the notes and saved a lot of time of adjusting the format. A very general markup language is Markdown.
2. Sync between different clients.

Tools

- Evernote + [Marxico](https://marxi.co/)
- [WizNote](https://www.wiz.cn/)

# Generation 3: take notes based on events/tasks/issues/questions (Event Driven)

<br />

Requirements

1. Support markup language.
2. Sync between different clients.
3. Events based. This way is consistent with programmers' daily work - when we need to implement features or fix bugs:
    - We will have (a ticket)/(an issue) for each event
    - We update the issue with comments
    - We can manage and filter tickets with different attributes - labels, time estimation, priority ...
    - We can build different boards to track them

Tools
- [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
- [gitlab issues](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/issues)
- [github issues](https://github.com/issues)

# Generation 4: use infinite-zoom lists for better structure

<br />

Requirements

1. Support markup language.
2. Sync between different clients.
3. Event level view support.
4. Infinite-zoom lists. Can zoom in and zoom out easily

    - Zoom in to focus on an item, then it just likes an event-based view
    - Zoom out to have a high level structure view

    With time going, we will experience more events/points and then we will build a more comprehensive structure.
