# Why do I write this post?

<br />

Coming to Singapore is a big decision for me, and I gave up a lot for this. Record the consideration process can remind me what I'm coming for.

# How do I evaluate a job?

<br />

1. I evaluate a job by a list of dimensions (d1, d2, ... dn)
1. For each dimension, I set a weight value (w1, w2, ... wn)
1. For each job, give a score to each dimension (s1, s2, ... sn)
1. Calculate the score for one job (score = w1 \* s1 + w2 \* s2 + ... + wn \* sn)
1. Choice the one that has the highest score

# Which dimensions do I take into consideration?

<br />

1. Salary - (Living Cost)
1. Salary Increase Speed
1. Rising Space
1. Business Status
1. Business Prospects
1. Team Members
1. Working Content
1. Technical Autonomy
1. Working Hours
1. Welfare
1. Risk
1. Family

# How to assign the weight value?

<br />

The importance of each dimension is varied for each person. To this model, a higher value should represent the better direction to compare the final score.

# Some details

<br />

- Working overtime

  The trend of working overtime in the domestic Internet industry is too serious. I was in Baidu in the past four years and worked overtime a lot. When I think about it carefully today, most of the overtime is meaningless. It damaged my body a lot.

- Competitive Differentiation
  - China does not lack general computer talents. A lot of fresh graduates worked very hard. With accumulating experience two or three years, they can handle most of the basic tasks. A lot of China's companies treat employees as labor.
  - With the development of China and the growth of Chinese companies, they may need more talents with overseas work experience.
  - Many foreign companies provide some good jobs in China, and they prefer candidates with overseas work experience.

- Space
  - Southeast Asia's Internet is growing rapidly.
  - In China, the monopoly of Internet companies has taken shape.

- Personal
  - I don't want to do trivial tasks all days anymore.
  - I want to struggle once more before getting old.
  - I don't want this to be the culmination of my life.

# What's my targets?

<br />

- As the growing space of basic salary is small for me, I need to find the start point of my own business.
- Contribute more to the open source community. I don't like to be asked basic interview questions anymore.
- Be healthier by exercise
- Investment
- Improve the level of communication with English


This is my original intention. Even though I can't predict the result,  I'll try my best!
